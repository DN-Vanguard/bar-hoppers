# Bar-Hoppers

## <u>Project Description</u>
Coming out of an unprecedented era of quarantines and social reclusiveness there are many new "bar hoppers" and others who may feel as if their social skills hit a hard reset over the last year and a half. Our app aims to give the user a less stressful expierence in which they are able to order with confidence and be exposed to new drink options they previously might not have known about.

**AUDIENCE**:
Socially anxious bar patrons, new bar patrons, and curious bar patrons

**PROBLEM**:
After such a long period with little to no social interaction for many people it is not uncommon for people to feel a reversion in their social skills. There has also been a large influx of recently legal drinking age people who have never got the chance to go out to bars and may feel intimidated by the vast choices and complexity of the drinking world.

**PRODUCT SOLUTION**:
An app that will give the user confidence and accuracy to choose what they want to drink, with out the stress of not knowing what they will get.

**MVP FEATURES**:


# User Story
```
AS A new bar patron coming out of COVID era,
I WANT to explore many recommended accessible cocktail options that would introduce me to new drinks,
SO THAT I can order with confidence and keep track of my favorites all in one place.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
